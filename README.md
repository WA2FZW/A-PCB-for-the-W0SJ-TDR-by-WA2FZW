In the May 2021 edition of QST Magazine, Stan Johnson (W0SJ)
published an article describing a device one can hook to an
oscilloscope to turn it into a time domain reflectometer
(TDR). Stan built his basically out of parts from the junque
box for which he deserves kudos!

I hate hand wiring stuff so I decided to design a printed
circuit board for it. My board makes a few changes in Stanâ€™s
design which made the PCB layout a bit neater and added a
couple of features, but otherwise it is basically the same
as his design.

With a lot of help from Glenn Percy (VK3PE), the PCB can be
built using either through-hole components or SMD components
or a combbination of both.

In addition to the Gerber files and a document that describes
the PCB and some more information on it's use, there are two
Android apps developed by Roderick Wall (VK3YC). One allows
you to calculate the length of a piece of coax and the other
allows you to compute the velocity factor of a known length
of coax.
